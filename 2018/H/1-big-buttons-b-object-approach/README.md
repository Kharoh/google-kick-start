## NOTE

The logic in this solution is essentially the same as the [class-approach solution](../1-big-buttons-a-class-approach). However, the trie implementation is done using JavaScript object structure instead of a class.

## Usage

[solution.js](solution.js) file is the solution to be submitted to Google Kick Start site. It gets perfect score with both small and large dataset. Note that Google Kick Start uses Node version 4.8.2.

[solution.test.js](solution.test.js) contains tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Tests are based on the samples on Google site and my own analysis. To run the test, make sure you have recent stable node version ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) would be helpful here) and run the following in your console:

```
npm install
npm run test
```
