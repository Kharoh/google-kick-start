This solution passes both the test set 1 (14 points) and test set 2 (19 points).

## Usage

First, install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run tests with jest:

```
npm run test
```

Build the solution into one file output at `build/solution.js`:

```
npm run build
```

`build/solution.js` is the code to be submitted to Google Kick Start site.

To run and test `build/solution.js` manually, open up a new console, use node 4.8.2 and run:

```
npm run start
```
